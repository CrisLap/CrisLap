# Hi , :clap: I'm Cristian

I have a  quantitative degree in Finance and, since I have always been interested in the deep understanding of data, now Iâ€™m a Data Science lover.
Here you can find all my personal projects and those that I realized for Python and Data Science courses I studied.
My aim is to spread my knowledge and edit all my resources in a well documented and explanatory way, with the hope that anyone can consult my repositories and find something useful and interesting!

## About me:
I'm currently studying Data Science <br>
I'd like to realize collaborations for Data Science, Python scripts and open-source projects!
## Goals:
Complete Data Science course on start2impact <br>
Continue working in my current field using my newly acquired skills or become a fully-fledged Data Scientist <br>
Overall Goals:
Merge AI and ML technologies with Automotive and NLT ( my current field);<br>
I'm also interested in Climate Change and Life Science;<br>
Help building a better future for the world<br>
