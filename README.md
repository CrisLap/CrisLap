ðŸ‘‹ Hi , I'm Cristian

I have a  quantitative degree in Finance, but now Iâ€™m an aspiring Data Scientist.
Here you can find all my personal projects and those that I realized for Python and Data Science courses I studied.
My aim is to spread my knowledge and edit all my resources in a well documented and explanatory way, with the hope that anyone can consult my repositories and find something useful and interesting!

About me:
I'm currently studying Machine Learning to achieve the role of Data Scientist
I'd like to realize collaborations for Data Science, Python scripts and open-source projects!
2022 Goals:
Complete Data Science course on start2impact;
Work as a Data Scientist
Overall Goals:
Merge AI and ML technologies with Automotive/Climate Change and or Life Science;
Help building a better future for the world;
Die in peace (possibly elder)
Fun fact: I keep falling in 'rabbit holes' because I'm obsessed with knowledge
